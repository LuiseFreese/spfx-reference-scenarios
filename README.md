To build and start using these projects, you'll need to clone and build the projects.

Clone this repository by executing the following command in your console:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/pnp/spfx-reference-scenarios.git

Navigate to the cloned repository folder which should be the same as the repository name:

```shell
cd spfx-reference-scenarios
```

To access the samples use the following command, where you replace `sample-folder-name` with the name of the sample you want to access and `sample-source` with the folder that contains the sample name ending in -spfx which is the source code.

```shell
cd samples
cd sample-folder-name
cd sample-source
```

Now run the following command to install the npm packages:

```shell
npm install
```

This will install the required npm packages and dependencies to build and run the client-side project.

Once the npm packages are installed, run the following command to preview your web parts in SharePoint Workbench:

```shell
gulp serve
```
